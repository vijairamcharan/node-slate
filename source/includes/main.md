# NN API Docs

<code-copy>

Welcome to the NN API Docs! Your one stop shop to find out all about our APIs we have marked as being ready for prime-time.

We have language bindings in cURL, TypeScript, Java and Python. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

<code-method>

<code-copy>

The NN API uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new The NN API API key at our [developer portal](https://example.com/developers).

The NN API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class=notice>
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

The NN API's API key authentication is a simplified approach to secure API access. It provides a basic level of authentication by requiring the API key to be included in the request header. This helps verify the identity of the requester and grants access to the API resources. However, it's important to note that this method may not be suitable for all security requirements.

For advanced security measures, The NN API provides additional documentation on topics such as ForgeRock, JWT exchange, and device binding. ForgeRock is a comprehensive identity and access management platform that can be integrated with The NN API's API for enhanced security controls. It offers features like single sign-on, user provisioning, and fine-grained access management.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) exchange is another advanced topic worth exploring. By implementing JWT-based authentication, The NN API can generate and exchange tokens securely, allowing users to access protected resources. JWTs can carry information about the user and their permissions, providing a stateless and scalable solution for authentication and authorization.

Device binding is yet another important aspect of securing API access. It involves binding the API key to a specific device, ensuring that requests can only be made from that authorized device. This prevents unauthorized usage of the API key even if it gets compromised.

For more detailed information and implementation guidelines on these advanced topics, please refer to the respective documentation provided by The NN API. These measures enable you to tailor the security of your API integration based on your specific needs and ensure the protection of sensitive data.

<code-example>

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'The NN API'

api = The NN API::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import The NN API

api = The NN API.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```bash
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
import { The NN API } from "The NN API";

const api = The NN API.authorize("meowmeowmeow");
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

# Customers

## Get All Customers

<code-method>

<code-copy>

This endpoint retrieves all customers.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://example.com/api/kittens`

### Query Parameters

| Parameter    | Default | Description                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

</code-copy>

<code-example>

```ruby
require 'The NN API'

api = The NN API::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import The NN API

api = The NN API.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```bash
curl "https://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
import { The NN API } from "The NN API";

const api = The NN API.authorize("meowmeowmeow");
const kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```

</code-example>

</code-method>

## Get a Specific Kitten

```ruby
require 'The NN API'

api = The NN API::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get(2)
```

```python
import The NN API

api = The NN API.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get(2)
```

```bash
curl "https://example.com/api/kittens/2"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
import { The NN API } from "The NN API";

const api = The NN API.authorize("meowmeowmeow");
const max = api.kittens.get(2);
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Max",
  "breed": "unknown",
  "fluffiness": 5,
  "cuteness": 10
}
```

This endpoint retrieves a specific kitten.
